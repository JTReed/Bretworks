Questions--
1. For each location/connectivity combination, which REST API call takes the longest complete? Is the answer the same for all location/connectivity combinations? Does this mean the delay for this REST API call is primarily determined by the browser, the last-mile connection, or the remote service?
2. For one of the REST API calls (e.g., IP-based geolocation), how long does it take for each location/connectivity combination? Over which network (i.e. last-mile connection) does the call complete the fastest? The slowest? What is one possible networking explanation for these results?
3. If you add the time taken to fetch the page (metric #2) to the time taken to render the page (metric #3) does it equal the time reported for metric #4? Why or why not?\
